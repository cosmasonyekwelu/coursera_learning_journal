## üìù Lecture Notes

### Core Blockchain Design Principles

#### 1. Decentralization

**Definition:** Elimination of central authorities and intermediaries

**Key Aspects:**

- **Network Architecture:** Peer-to-peer instead of client-server
- **Decision Making:** Distributed consensus instead of top-down
- **Data Storage:** Redundant across all nodes instead of centralized databases

**Implementation Examples:**

- **Bitcoin:** 10,000+ nodes worldwide
- **Ethereum:** Global node network
- **IPFS:** Distributed file storage

#### 2. Transparency & Auditability

**Definition:** All transactions and state changes are publicly visible

**Key Aspects:**

- **Public Ledger:** Anyone can verify transactions
- **Open Source:** Code is publicly available and auditable
- **Immutable History:** Permanent record of all activities

**Benefits:**

- Reduced information asymmetry
- Enhanced trust through verifiability
- Improved regulatory compliance

#### 3. Security Through Cryptography

**Definition:** Mathematical proofs instead of trusted third parties

**Key Cryptographic Elements:**

- **Hash Functions:** Data integrity and linking
- **Digital Signatures:** Authentication and non-repudiation
- **Public Key Cryptography:** Secure ownership and transfer

**Security Properties:**

- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance:** Resilience to malicious actors
- **Cryptoeconomic Security:** Economic incentives for honest behavior
- **Immutable Records:** Tamper-evident data storage

#### 4. Immutability

**Definition:** Inability to alter recorded transactions

**Technical Implementation:**

- **Cryptographic Linking:** Each block contains hash of previous block
- **Consensus Rules:** Network rejects invalid chains
- **Economic Cost:** Prohibitively expensive to rewrite history

**Implications:**

- **Positive:** Trust in historical records
- **Negative:** Irreversible mistakes and bugs

#### 5. Consensus Mechanisms

**Definition:** Methods for achieving agreement in distributed systems

**Primary Types:**

- **Proof of Work (PoW):** Computational effort as stake
- **Proof of Stake (PoS):** Economic stake as collateral
- **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS):** Elected validators
- **Proof of Authority (PoA):** Reputation-based validation

### The Blockchain Trilemma

#### The Fundamental Challenge

Blockchains struggle to simultaneously achieve all three desired properties:

1. **Decentralization:** No single point of control
2. **Security:** Resistance to attacks
3. **Scalability:** High transaction throughput

#### Trade-off Examples

- **Bitcoin:** Strong decentralization & security, but limited scalability (~7 TPS)
- **Ethereum PoW:** Good decentralization & security, moderate scalability (~15-30 TPS)
- **Solana:** High scalability & security, but concerns about decentralization
- **Ethereum PoS:** Improved scalability while maintaining decentralization & security

### Major Blockchain Challenges

#### 1. Scalability Limitations

**The Problem:**

- Limited transactions per second compared to traditional systems
- Network congestion during high usage periods
- Rising transaction fees making micro-transactions impractical

**Current State Comparison:**
| System | Transactions Per Second (TPS) |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| Bitcoin | 7 |
| Ethereum | 15-30 |
| Visa | 24,000+ |
| Target for Mass Adoption | 100,000+ |

**Scalability Solutions:**

- **Layer 2 Solutions:** Lightning Network, Rollups
- **Sharding:** Horizontal partitioning of blockchain state
- **Alternative Consensus:** PoS, DPoS for higher throughput
- **Sidechains:** Parallel chains with different characteristics

#### 2. Energy Consumption & Environmental Impact

**The Problem:**

- **Ethereum PoW:** ~75 TWh/year (Chile-level consumption)
- **Ethereum PoS:** ~0.01 TWh/year (99.95% reduction)

**Solutions & Alternatives:**
