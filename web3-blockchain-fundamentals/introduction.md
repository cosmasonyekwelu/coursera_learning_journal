## üéØ Week 1 Overview

This week introduces the fundamental concepts of Web3 and blockchain technology, exploring the evolution from centralized to decentralized systems and the core principles that make blockchain transformative.

## üìñ Learning Objectives

- Understand what Web3 represents in the evolution of the internet
- Learn the basic concepts of blockchain technology
- Explore the principles of decentralization
- Identify key differences between traditional and decentralized systems

## üìù Detailed Notes

### 1. The Evolution of the Web

**Web1 (1990-2004):** The "Read-Only" Web

- Static websites, limited interaction
- Content created by few, consumed by many
- Examples: Basic HTML pages, early portals

**Web2 (2004-Present):** The "Read-Write" Web

- Dynamic, interactive websites
- User-generated content, social media
- Centralized platforms (Facebook, Google, Amazon)
- **Issue:** Data silos, privacy concerns, platform control

**Web3 (Emerging):** The "Read-Write-Trust" Web

- Decentralized protocols
- User ownership of data and digital assets
- Trust through cryptography, not intermediaries

### 2. What is Blockchain?

**Core Definition:** A distributed, immutable ledger that records transactions in a verifiable and permanent way.

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Decentralized:** No single authority controls the network
- **Immutable:** Records cannot be altered once written
- **Transparent:** All transactions are visible to participants
- **Secure:** Cryptographic techniques ensure integrity

### 3. How Blockchain Works (Basic)

1. **Transaction Request:** User initiates a transaction
2. **Broadcast:** Transaction is broadcast to the P2P network
3. **Validation:** Network nodes validate the transaction
4. **Block Creation:** Validated transactions are grouped into a block
5. **Consensus:** Network agrees on the valid block
6. **Chain Addition:** Block is added to the existing blockchain

### 4. Key Terminology

- **Block:** A collection of transactions with a timestamp
- **Chain:** Sequential linking of blocks through cryptographic hashes
- **Node:** Any computer that participates in the network
- **Consensus Mechanism:** Protocol for agreeing on transaction validity
- **Cryptography:** Mathematical techniques for security and verification

## üí° Key Insights & Takeaways

### Major "Aha!" Moments

1. **Web3 isn't just about technology** - it's about rethinking digital ownership and trust
2. **Blockchain's immutability** creates unprecedented data integrity
3. **Decentralization challenges** traditional business models fundamentally

### Important Concepts to Remember

- Trust shifts from institutions to code and mathematics
- Transparency doesn't necessarily mean privacy loss (pseudonymity)
- The "double-spend" problem was a major blockchain innovation solve

## ‚ùì Questions & Research Topics

- [ ] How do different consensus mechanisms actually work in practice?
- [ ] What are the current limitations of blockchain scalability?
- [ ] How does cryptocurrency mining impact energy consumption?
- [ ] What's the difference between permissioned and permissionless blockchains?

## üîó Additional Resources Discovered

- [ ] [Bitcoin Whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) - Satoshi Nakamoto's original paper
- [ ] [Ethereum Foundation Website](https://ethereum.org/) - Official documentation
- [ ] [Course Discussion Forums] - Peer insights and questions

## üìö Weekly Summary

This week laid the crucial foundation for understanding why Web3 and blockchain matter. The shift from centralized control to decentralized trust represents one of the most significant technological paradigm shifts since the internet itself. The key takeaway is that we're moving from "trusting intermediaries" to "trusting mathematics and code."
